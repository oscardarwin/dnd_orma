### Moira's Trusty Shiv
Target a creature you can see. Spend one strength token and a number of finesse tokens (minimum of 1) to deal a number of d6s in damage equal to the number of finesse tokens you spent.
### Bardic Inspiration
Target a single ally and inspire them. You then spend a number of charisma action tokens to grant that ally a number of charisma action tokens equal to the number you spent + 1.
### Charm Explosion
You scatter a collection of charms onto the floor causing creatures to lose their balance. Spend 1 Intuition Action Token, then spend a number of Finesse action tokens (minimum of one) and make an ability check with that number of d20s. The effect is determined on the table below:
