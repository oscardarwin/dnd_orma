## Features

### Upper Echelons
When you make a charisma ability check to persuade or lie to a person from a wealthy background, you may add a d8 to the roll.

### Noble Knowledge
When you make a knowledge check to recall facts about noble families and businesses in the D.C.Q, you may add a d4 to the roll.

## Actions

### Magic Coin
Place your hand around your secret family heirloom. After a creature performs an action, you may spend 1 intuition and 1 charisma action token to refund those action tokens back to the creature.

### Silverbrook Sword
You may spend a number of strength action tokens to attack a creature you can see dealing 1d8 of damage for each action token you spent. If this damage surpases the creatures armor class you may in addition:
1. Spend 1 Finesse Action Token to trip the creature. It must discard all strength tokens.
2. Alert your allies to a vulnerability. Spend 1 Knowledge Action Token to decrease the creatures armor class by 1 until the end of its next turn. 

### Clever Distraction
Craft a distraction tailored to a creature of your choice. Spend 1 Knowledge Action Token, then spend a number of Charisma action tokens (minimum of one) and make a DC12 ability check with that number of d20s. If the check succeeds, the creature discards all of their finesse and intuition action tokens.
