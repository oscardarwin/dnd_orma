## Moves

### Magic Coin [Reaction]
When a creature you can see makes an ability check, place your hand around your secret family heirloom. 
Flip a coin, on tails you take 1 damage and on heads you can add either +/-3 to the roll. 

### Silverbrook Sword [Action]
You may spend a number of action tokens to attack a creature you can see dealing 1d8 of damage for each action token you spent. If this damage surpases the creatures armor class you may in addition:
1. Spend 1 Action Token to trip the creature. It must discard 1 action token.
2. Alert your allies to a vulnerability. Make a DC12 Knowledge check. On a success the creatures armor class decreases by 1 until the end of its next turn. 

### Clever Distraction [Action]
Craft a distraction tailored to a creature of your choice. Spend 1 Action Token, then spend a number of action tokens (minimum of one) and make a DC15 charisma ability check with that number of d20s. If the check succeeds, the creature discards 2 action tokens.
