Your collection of modifiers is known as your _ability spread_.

### Hit Points
Your number of hit points is 5 + your strength modifier. 

### Armor Class
Your strength score determines how heavy your armor can be. 
The weight of armor you can wear, and subsequent armor class is given in the table below.

| Strength Modifier | Armor Type | Armor Class |
| :---------------- | :--------: | :---------: |
| 1                 |   Light    |      3      |
| 2                 |   Medium   |      5      |
| 3                 |   Heavy    |      8      |

## Ability Checks
When you wish to do an action which has a mixed chance of success, the DM will ask you to make an ability check.
To make the check, the DM first specifies the type of ability check. 
They may or may not specify the difficulty class (DC). 
You then roll a number of d20s equal to your ability modifier corresponding to that type. 
If highest d20 roll is greater than or equal to the difficulty class, your action succeeds.

## Initiative
When precise ordering of actions is required (such as combat), we enter into initiative. 

All players roll a Intuition Ability Check to a specified DC. 
If at least one of the players is successful, the players act first. 
If nobody is successful, the DM acts first.

### Action Tokens
Initiative begins with each player having a certain number of action tokens. 
Each player rolls a number of d4s equal to their intuition modifier. 
They then start with a number of action tokens  equal to the maximum of the d4s.
At the start of each player turn, each player rolls a d4 adding a number of action tokens equal to that numer.
### Powering Up
You may choose to forfeit spending any action tokens on the player turn and instead spend the time planning. Increase your number of action tokens by your knowledge modifier. As part of this move, you may also describe a course of action that wish to take. The DM decides if any ability checks are required to achieve your goal.
## Damage
When damage is inflicted on you, you lose a number of hitpoints equal to the damage minus divided by your armor class and then rounded down.
### Dodging
When damage is inflicted on you, you may choose to dodge. Spend one action token and you can increase your armor class temporarily by your finesse modifier.
## Long Rests
By spending 8 hours spent sleeping or doing light activity in a safe location, you can recover 1 hit point up to your hit point maximum. 
During this time, one other creature can make a DC15 knowledge ability check to increase the number of hitpoints you regain by 1.
## Death
When your hit points are reduced to 0, you have two choices:
### Last Stand
You gain 10 action tokens of your choice which you must spend immediately. 
No allies can spend action tokens until you have finished spending your action tokens. 
When you are done spending action tokens, your character dies and cannot be revived without magical means. 
Then, each ally of yours that can see or hear you gains 7 action tokens of their choice.
### Battle Scar
You survive but suffer a permanent grievous wound to be agreed between you and the DM. 
Your hit points remain at 0 until you take a long rest. 
All of your ability modifiers are reduced to 1 and you must subtract 5 from every ability check you make. 
Each day an ally can make DC15 knowledge ability check to increase one ability modifier of your choice by 1, up to a maximum of its original values. 
When your ability scores reach their original values, the -5 penalty ends.
